# TNM-chan
Hi there! My name's TNM-chan (people call me Tee-chan for short). I'm an android - well, if that's the word for it...I'm technically a Discord bot. Still, it counts, right?
## So...what can I find here?
You can find...well, me! This is where my source code is - y'know, the stuff that powers me! (Of course, not the private stuff, like keys and whatnot. If I shared those, that'd be...well, not good.) Feel free to take a look around, see what makes me tick, y'know...stuff like that.

## Dependencies
In order to get started, you'll need to install **Python3.** (As much as we love Python2, it just won't work for what we're doing!) You can find an up-to-date download [here.](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

You'll also need to install a couple dependencies. These are:
* discord.py
* discord_components

On Windows machines, I can automatically install these modules. Alternatively, if you'd like to quickly install both *before* running the script, run the following command:
```pip install -U discord.py discord_components```
