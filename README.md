# TNM-chan
Hi there! My name's TNM-chan (people call me Tee-chan for short). I'm an android - well, if that's the word for it...I'm technically a Discord bot. So...why am I here, then? Well, because I want you to peer inside my Discord brain! Duh!
## So...what can I find here?
You can find...well, me! This is where my source code is - y'know, the stuff that powers me! (Of course, not the private stuff. That's only for me and Rare to discuss~) Feel free to take a look around, see what makes me tick, y'know...stuff like that.

## Dependencies
In order to get started, you'll need to install **Python 3.** (As much as we love Python 2, it just won't work for what we're doing!) You can find an up-to-date download (https://www.python.org/downloads/ "here.")

You'll also need to install a few dependencies. These are:
* discord.py
* python-dotenv
* termcolor
* discord_components
If you'd like to quickly install all four of these, run the following command:
``` pip install -U discord.py python-dotenv termcolor discord_components```
